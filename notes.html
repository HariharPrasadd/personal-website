                    At some level this proxy of process can be generalized to entire life trajectories. The ideal "process" of life is high school, then a prestigious college, then a job, when the goal of all this behaviour is capital creation, the goal of which again is to live a good life. Funnily enough process oriented behaviour almost always ends up in people being miserable.

                    Status games make me sick and this helped me understand they evoke such a visceral reaction in me - however sophisticated, they still blindly follow the "wisdom" of the many. Like so many other things in life, the problem-space thus becomes predefined and most people start optimizing in solution-space without ever wondering if the question which the solution answers is even worth answering.

                <div class="note-quote">"Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to."</div>

I actually like this small snippet so much more because there's something so simple about it. When the path to greatness is laid out in front of you, the only sticking point remaining is how hard you're willing to work for it. And seeing your reaction to how hard you'll have to work is a pretty good indicator of whether you're going to make it.

                    Shows you why comparison is futile. Subjective experience is subjective for a reason - you, and you alone experience life from your perspective. No matter how alive others look, to you, they are simply objects amongst other objects. You're trying to compare apples and A-10 warthogs. The only true value is that which is recognised and propagated by the self.

                    The section preceding this quote talks about man transcending himself through a project, and the inevitable realisation that the project too, is not a satisfactory end in and of itself, because it can be transcended again. On the realisation of the futility of all things, how is man to continue striving? Perhaps it is worthy to consider that there exists life apart from projects. There exists meaning in people. And that's beautiful.

                    Purpose has always played a very important part in my life. The question of whether it is discovered or invented is a fundamental one, but I don't have an answer to it yet. All I know is that there is no meaning of life - there is only meaning in life. Still, I think it's important to remember that purpose, like everything else, is a construct of the human mind. Taking yourself too seriously is never too good for your own health.

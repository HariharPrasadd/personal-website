                <div class="book-rating">★★★★★★★</div>
                <div class="book-summary">A very short primer on the current state of anti-aging research and the underlying science behind it. It was a <em>lot</em> more technical than I expected, giving me a run through of basically the entirety of a first year molecular biology course in the first 100 pages, and continued to be just as insightful in other ways throughout. Great read, 100% recommend.</div>

                <div class="book-rating">★★★★★★★<span style="color: rgb(208, 162, 21);">★</span></div>
                <div class="book-summary">A book introducing, elaborating upon, and pondering upon the consequences of the predictive processing model of the mind. If you are going to read one book from my recommendations, read this one. It is the book that has changed the way I think the most in the <em>most</em> domains, from interpersonal interactions to self-perception to decision making. The idea that reality is not in and of itself an act of <em>feature detection</em>, but an active probabilistic resolution of a downward facing <em>hypothesis</em> of what the world looks like and an upward flow of prediction error from perception seems relatively simple, but has insanely widespread and impactful consequences.</div>

                <div class="book-rating">★★★★★★☆</div>
                <div class="book-summary">A Harry Potter fan fiction where Harry is a devout rationalist and swears by the scientific method, written by the founder of the modern rationalist movement. Really more of a fantasy/science fiction book rather than a rationalist manifesto though, despite rich examples of proper rational thought and well-crafted experiments. It was an absolute blast to read, did <em>not</em> feel like it was almost 2000 pages long. Note: It's oddly fun to read books where everyone is super smart.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">Sand, salt, iron, copper, oil and lithium. A book on the materials that build our world - how they are mined, transported and how important they are. It was a very interesting and informative read, but the power law applies very strongly - 90% of the value I got from this book was from 10% of the content. Knowing that one of the main reasons for American semiconductor dominance is <em>one</em> quartz mine, or that 97% of UK's chlorine supply comes from one plant just changes the way you look at the world and supply chains.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">A book on how fungi shape our lives and the world around us. One of the best written books on a niche, specific, scientific topic I've read. A beautiful blend of philosophy, technicality and prose. Turns out we can learn a <em>lot</em> from fungi.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">Picked this one up expecting self-help, found economic theory instead. Unexpected, but it was a great read.

                <div class="book-rating">★★★★☆☆☆</div>
                <div class="book-summary">A book about how social virality comes about. It was quite good - the models of connectors, mavens and salesmen were quite usefful to know. Well written as well. Just lacked that <em>oomph</em> - a short and satisfying read nonetheless.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">A book about why some people succeed and others don't (news flash: it focuses mostly on factors out of your control).

                <div class="book-summary">The seminal work on the flow state, what it looks like, and how to consistently achieve it. Still not able to enter flow on command, but this book was a veritable treasure trove of scientific, actionable information. A bit dense, but it's not too bad.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">A Stoic classic. Lots of really insightful snippets, but the lack of a cohesive narrative and the disparate nature of the meditations themselves makes it a bit hard to crystallize every insight into actionable mental frameworks.

                <div class="book-rating">★★★★★★★</div>
                <div class="book-summary">The only series that's managed to make me reread each of its <em>two</em> books more than four times, <em>individually</em>. Not even in order. Each book is just that good by itself. The series is still in its infancy (two 1000-page books in might make it more of an adolescent, but Bryce does such an amazing job of building up the plot that it feels like the bulk of story is yet to come), but it's quickly become my favourite sci-fi series. Amazing premise, impeccable worldbuilding, and some of the best character building I've ever seen. Can't wait to read more.</div>

                <div class="book-summary">A beautiful book about the brevity of life and how to deal with existential dread. Flies in the face of quite literally everything valued by modern day society - productivity, overachievement, and the seemingly all-pervasive drive to "do more things". Makes you question <em>why</em> you're so hell-bent on being "productive", and makes you really think about the type of life you want to lead.</div>

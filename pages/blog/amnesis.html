        <h1>The Amnesis Hypothesis</h1>

        <p>Humanity is a network of individuals. Given that it is, why is there no software that benefits each and every
            level and member of this network regardless of its position, size, or any other arbitrary quality?</p>

        <p>Social networks connect humanity as a whole, but do little to benefit individual humans. Individual pieces of
            technology help humans, but their benefit to the collective is minimal except as mediums of communication
            (which is still an extremely valuable position to fill, but it just seems like we could be doing a lot more
            with how far technology has come).</p>

        <p><strong>Amnesis</strong> is the attempt to solve this. To build a modular, continuously scalable, ever
            improving framework of technology that benefits society at every level, from the individual to the network
            as a whole, and everything in between. The fact that it's modular means that it doesn't need to be fully
            assembled to be of use or value, but each successive development builds on the previous one to increase the
            total amount of good it can do.</p>

        <p>It consists of two primary interfaces (personal and social), with personal interfaces being subdivided into
            software and hardware. Let's dive into the software first.</p>

        <p>The goal of the personal interface is maximal personal augmentation — unlike other heavy duty LLMs where the
            bulk of the model is dedicated towards solving harder and harder tasks, Amnesis is laser-tailored for the
            interaction <em>with</em> and the augmentation <em>of</em> humans.</p>

        <p>To do so, it must satisfy two requirements. It must be <em>ambient</em> — it should listen and chime in when
            it thinks it can help based on an endless number of cues — voice, messages, geography, even thoughts (in the
            future). For now, Amnesis will not <em>do</em> things — its purpose is augmentation, not replacement. It
            will give you what you need, when you need it, before you need to ask.</p>

        <p>In order for it to pre-empt your needs, it needs as much <em>context</em> about your life as possible. This
            takes two forms: firstly, an easily searchable database of abstract concepts and ideas about your life that
            Amnesis builds through active conversations and textual input, which it then uses to give you information
            about a meeting, a friend, forgotten deadlines and so much more based on the cues mentioned before.</p>

        <p>Secondly, Amnesis needs as much real time data of you as possible — thoughts, heart rate, current physical
            activity etc. Amnesis can then train a model of the relation between your bodily/physical indicators and
            emotions/feelings/thoughts by tracking this data, periodically asking you questions about your current
            mental and emotional state when you first start using it, and using these answers to predict what you feel
            like using only real time data from external hardware devices. To put it more succinctly, it uses this real
            time data as training data, your answers as labels, and learns what certain patterns of behaviour/physical
            indicators actually mean for your emotions, and then uses this understanding to nudge you towards your goals
            and enforce better behaviour.</p>

        <p>The insightful reader might now understand the role that the hardware plays. Better hardware augments both
            Amnesis' ability to read <em>cues</em> to provide help, as well as to imbibe real time data to pre-empt your
            needs and understand you at a more fundamental level. This hardware will most probably not be a single,
            static device but somewhat of an active ecosystem of devices for interaction and data collection — current
            technology has been trending towards that for a good while (eg Apple's ecosystem), and integrating all of
            that data to form a reliable model seems feasible. These hardware modules will most probably be of two
            types: ones that collect data (smart watches, Whoops etc), and ones that allow people to interact with
            Amnesis more naturally (smart glasses, pendants, etc).</p>

        <p>We can now move from the personal interface to the societal interface.</p>

        <p>At the level of the personal interface, Amnesis lets us gather context about a person's life, as well as
            knowledge about how certain patterns of behaviour emerge in reaction to environmental stimuli. In essence,
            it knows <em>you</em> extremely well — your aspirations, your goals, your behaviours, your preferences, and
            so much more. With all this context, personal knowledge, and data, you can generate a maximally truthful
            representation of an individual. This representation is unique in that it cannot be fake unless the person
            fakes every single aspect of their life in order to present themselves in a certain way — it is a much more
            genuine expression of a person's true self than any social media consisting of curated and sanitised windows
            into their life ever could be.</p>

        <p>But the purpose of these representations, these <em>digital personas</em>, isn't to simply give other people
            a 24/7 look into your life. In fact, it's the opposite — it's to shift social media from something you
            <em>participate</em> in, to something you are at the centre of. This dynamic will be most pronounced once a
            majority of your immediate environment, and eventually humanity, has access to Amnesis and thus has a
            digital persona of their own. We can then create a network where all these digital personas are constantly
            trying to interface and work with other personas in order to achieve your goals and make your life better in
            line with your aspirations. These aspirations do not need to solely be professional — for example, a persona
            that intimately knows your preferences and your behaviours as they <em>actually</em> are can help you find
            love. It can help you find friends. It can suggest things to do and ideas to chase that you never even
            thought about. Just having this persona opens up countless other doors.</p>

        <p>Digital celebrities in this era can be the personas that are the most genuinely helpful/entertaining in your
            day to day life, which means the reward function changes from performative status games to genuine value
            creation. Over a long enough time scale, these personas can give you the ability to talk to long dead people
            and pick the brains of the greats across infinite swathes of time.</p>

        <p>Your digital persona can operate within boundaries that <em>you</em> define, from as strict as zero
            interaction to taking actions on your behalf. Whether this level of autonomy be left to the user is an open
            question. Ideally, Amnesis only gathers information and reaches out for opportunities, periodically
            presenting its results to you to act on.</p>

        <p>This entire plan rests on a few critical hypotheses (continually updated as we find more), which include but
            are not limited to (in rough order of importance):</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Amnesis can actually improve quality of life/augment performance enough for it to be an extremely sticky
                product.</li>
            <li>Amnesis can be trained effectively on extremely sparse datasets (input streams) to generate reliable
                predictions (pre-empt needs).</li>
            <li>Amnesis can effectively scale up its database to encompass years of continuous human experience, and
                still effectively search across it.</li>
            <li>Additional input streams can help make Amnesis more effective and allow humans to interface with Amnesis
                well enough to warrant a switch from traditional hardware.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If I successfully pull this off, the world will be permanently changed. In order to ensure it is for the
            better, there are a few extremely important moral and technical aspects to address (continually updated):
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Data privacy. Everything has to be encrypted and stored as strongly as possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is the root for all further development and thought about Amnesis.</p>

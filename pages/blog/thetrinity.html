        <h1>The trinity</h1>
        <p>There exists a holy trinity of the mind, body and soul. Mind is clarity and understanding. Soul is purpose. Body is the ability to take action.</p>
        <p>Progress consists of improvements in each of these three spheres. Knowledge on self-improvement addresses improvement in one or more of these spheres, at a certain stage.</p>
        <p>Lacking in any of these three spheres results in unfulfilled potential. Average individuals lack all three. Without mind, planning and structure is absent, and action perceived to further the pursuit of purpose instead becomes busywork. Without soul, tasks given will be completed efficiently but in the absence of external goals life becomes stagnant. There exists a lack of internal direction, and thus an individual with only mind and body will do many things, but his greatness is dependent on his immediate external environment. Without body, one exists in a torturous state of crystal clear clarity and purpose on what he must do, but floats around in a constant haze â€“ not one of confusion, but one of lethargy and a lack of action.</p>

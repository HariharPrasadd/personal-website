        <h1>The Pareto Frontier of Effort and Experience</h1>

        <p>Society seems to have this conception of a trade-off between effort and experience. That if you work a lot, you're missing out on a lot of life, and that simply being a workaholic will somehow rob you of the breadth of human experience and leave behind a sad, exhausted rag of misery because most people hate their jobs and find it mind-boggling to even comprehend the fact that certain individuals have a burning drive and desire to make a change, and are willing to do anything to achieve that.</p>

        <p>The death of the extremes.</p>

        <p>Anyways, this <em>is</em> true, at the very, very, <em>very</em> extremes. Elon Musk probably does not experience as much of the world as a nature-loving backpacker who goes out and explores the world. But does the <em>average</em> person do that either? I don't think so. Most people who yield this criticism do not "experience" much in their life at all - their definition of experience is simply drinking, hanging out with friends, having "fun" - all of which is valid and <em>does</em> contribute to human experience, I am in no way disparaging that - but you have to work a <em>lot</em> before things like that are even at risk of sacrifice.</p>

        <p>I do not think most people understand just how much time they have in their days. You can work a <em>lot</em> before it starts impinging on your ability to "experience" life. I'm talking 17-20 hour days 6 days a week before you start missing out on vital life experiences.</p>

        <p>Be desperate. Be extraordinary.</p>

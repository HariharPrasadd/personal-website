        <h1>Terminal misdiagnosis</h1>

        <p>terminal<br>
        | ˈtəːmɪnl |<br>
        (of a disease) predicted to lead to death, especially slowly; incurable.</p>

        <p>misdiagnosis<br>
        | ˌmɪsdʌɪəɡˈnəʊsɪs |<br>
        an incorrect diagnosis of an illness or other problem.</p>

        <p>terminal misdiagnosis<br>
        | ˈtəːmɪnl ˌmɪsdʌɪəɡˈnəʊsɪs |<br>
        an incorrect diagnosis of an illness or other problem that will lead one to death, slowly - yet not incurable.</p>

        <p>Time and time again, I find myself face-to-face with this oh-so fundamental tenet of being human. When faced with a problem, the first act to solving it is always analysis - and as humans, we tend to have a predisposition to always wanting to <em>solve</em> whatever problem pops up in front of us, before even taking a moment to ask about the value of the so-called problem, or in the rare cases that we do, doing such a horrible job at our analysis that it leaves us with a irrevocably mistaken conception of what the <em>problem</em> even is.</p>

        <p>It has happened to me <em>a lot</em> - a hurried analysis results in a flawed understanding of a problem that then results in lots of wasted effort.</p>

        <p>Terminal misdiagnosis stems from a lacking understanding of the problem, as well a desire to <em>solve</em> it in whatever way one can, leading to a knee-jerk assignment of a value to a problem. To be completely honest, it could stem from a myriad of things however - disinterest in getting to the root of a problem, assumptions, excessive utilization of heuristics - the causes are endless, but the outcome is one - <em>terminal misdiagnosis</em>.</p>

        <p>The solution, although I am not sure if this can be called as such just yet for I have not implemented it myself, is first principles thinking.</p>

        <p>Building up <em>everything</em> from complete scratch, and throwing all errors for whom assumptions and heuristics are the cause out the window.</p>

        <p>As to avoid the problem of terminal misdiagnosis when it comes to utilizing and formulating the <em>principles themselves</em> - that, I think, requires honing of the self, and a steadfast dedication to meditation.</p>

        <p>I will continue to document instances of terminal misdiagnosis both in my daily life and int eh works of others, and I will continue to expound on this concept when I get the time, for it is seemingly ever-present.</p>
